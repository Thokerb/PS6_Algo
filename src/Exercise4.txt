What is the asymptotic complexity of the entire 12-element sequence of actions from Exercise 3?

Assuming n = 8:

insert has a worst case complexity of O(log n), we have to do it n times
removeMin has a worst case complexity of O(log n), we also have to do it n times
-> n * O(log n) = O(n log n)
-> O(n log n) + O(n log n) = 2 * O(n log n) = O(n log n)

=> Complexity is O(n log n)
